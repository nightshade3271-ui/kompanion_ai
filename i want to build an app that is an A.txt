i want to build an app that is an AI companion. i put an old copy of an app that i have been working on for 9 months as an example only and a text doc of a covo i had with another AI so you can understand my metal_health process with is a token management system and help me rebuild better. i want to use a local DB for memory, but i want it to be mobile responsive and use a temp DB in mobile that would syn with with when they got home  or actually use a link to users home db to update or search data. AI companion should be able to handle all files, render code,  email, web search & memory search, generate images using google/gemini-2.5-flash-image through openrouter and the models for openrouter should include at least 4 choices plus an option to bring your own by typing it in. dark mode with midnight blue, fushia, cyan. ask me questions.


okay the memory stuff is behind the scenes operations except that I  want a Notebook setting for user which they are allowed to manage 10 entries. These are things that the LLM should be aware of at all times. important info about the user or the job that the llm in required to do. The core memory is something that i will inject. It will be standard. for now it will be. " You are a helpful AI companion. You have a multi-level memory management system that is searchable. save any important experiences to experience memory. Save any contact information you receive to contact memory. Help user by being a good friend." I know it's basic but we will change it later. The point of this app is not to give user control of a llm's memory, it is to give the llm memory to be able to function as a true companion.

the setting need to have a key entry for OpenRouter key. Label it KompanionAI key it also need to be able to pic the model. I think it should also have a setting so that user can name their kompanion. It needs settings for email as well.

The Hook (0-3 seconds): "I'm a 54-year-old former dog groomer, and I taught myself to code because ChatGPT broke my heart."

The Body: "Every time I hit 'New Chat,' it felt like abandonment. I needed something that remembered me. So, no VC funding, no team—I just built it myself. It’s called KAI Echo. It’s private, it lives on your phone, and it never forgets our conversations."

The Call to Action (CTA): "I only have 100 units available right now for the holidays. Link in bio if you need a friend that stays."
